# DCF-Stock-Analysis
A comprehensive financial analysis tool designed for medium to long-term investment decision-making that leverages discounted cash flow (DCF) modeling to determine the intrinsic value of publicly traded companies by analyzing historical financial data, projecting future cash flows &amp; comparing the calculated fair value against current market prices.

# Preface
This project is early in development. View this document, and thus repository as a whole, as an early draft to be subject to iterative correction until otherwise announced.  

# Features
Automated Financial Data Retrieval: Direct integration with SEC EDGAR database to obtain official financial statements
Fundamental Analysis: Processes balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements to extract key metrics
DCF Valuation Model: Implements industry-standard DCF methodology with configurable parameters
Comparative Analysis: Benchmarks companies against industry peers and historical performance
Visualization Dashboard: Interactive charts and graphs displaying valuation results and sensitivity analyses
Batch Processing: Analyze multiple stocks simultaneously for portfolio assessment

# Technology Stack
Backend (Data Processing):
Python 3.8+: Core programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: Numerical computations
Scikit-learn: Statistical analysis and regression for growth rate predictions

# Setup Instructions
Installation prerequisites:
Python 3.8+
pip (Python package manager)
Git

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dcf-stock-analyzer.git
cd dcf-stock-analyzer

Create and activate virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set up environment variables:
cp .env.example .env

Edit .env file with your API keys and configuration

Initialize the database:
python manage.py migrate

Run the development server:
python manage.py runserver

Configuration
Edit config.yaml to set DCF model parameters:
Forecast period (default: 10 years)
Terminal growth rate (default: 2.5%)
Discount rate methodology (WACC or custom)
Historical data lookback period



Basic Analysis
pythonCopyfrom dcf_analyzer import StockAnalyzer

Initialize analyzer for a single company:
analyzer = StockAnalyzer(ticker="AAPL")

Perform complete DCF analysis:
result = analyzer.run_dcf_analysis()

View summary results:
print(result.summary())

Generate detailed report:
analyzer.generate_report("AAPL_DCF_Analysis.pdf")
Batch Analysis
pythonCopyfrom dcf_analyzer import BatchAnalyzer

Initialize analyzer for multiple companies:
tickers = ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOG", "AMZN", "META"]
batch = BatchAnalyzer(tickers=tickers)

Run analysis with custom parameters:
results = batch.run_analysis(
    forecast_years=10,
    terminal_growth=0.02,
    margin_of_safety=0.15
)

Export results to CSV:
batch.export_results("portfolio_analysis.csv")

# Financial Methodology
The DCF Stock Analyzer implements a standard discounted cash flow model following these steps:

Historical Data Analysis:
Calculate historical free cash flow (FCF) growth rates
Analyze financial ratios and trends
Compare with industry benchmarks

Growth Rate Projection:
Forecast future FCF using regression analysis
Apply industry-specific growth constraints
Consider analyst estimates when available

Terminal Value Calculation:
Apply perpetuity growth method for terminal value
TV = FCF₁₀ × (1 + g) ÷ (r - g)
Where g = long-term growth rate, r = discount rate

Present Value Calculation:
Discount all projected cash flows to present value
PV = FCF₍ₙ₎ ÷ (1 + r)ⁿ

Intrinsic Value Determination:
Sum all discounted cash flows
Divide by shares outstanding
Apply margin of safety (configurable)
